# REACT CHAT APP


## How it's made. 

**Tech Used**: REACT | NODE.JS | TYPESCRIPT | JAVASCRIPT 
I wanted to make a chat app using chat engine tool. It is a complete fullstack app and it is fully functional.  

## Optimizations
In the future, it would be nice to optimize a few things
- increase overall speed on clicks and loads
- include user preferences with more MongoDB backend
- add additional search features
- add file sharing
- add different login options
- add notifications


## Lessons Learned
Since this was my first chat app I had to learn a lot about connecting to user files. I was also excited to use typescript and it has only increased my interest in learning more about it.
